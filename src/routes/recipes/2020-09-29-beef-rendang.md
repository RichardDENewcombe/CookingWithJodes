    directions_markdown: |-
      - For the paste, chop and place the shallots, lemongrass, garlic, ginger and chillis into a food processor and process until very finely chopped.
      - Heat the oil into a sauce pan and add the paste, cinnamon, cloves, star anise and cardamom. Stir until aromatic. 
      - Add the diced beef steak and additional lemongrass and stir for 1 minute.
      - Add the coconut milk, tamarind paste, water, and stir frequently on a medium heat until the beef is almost cooked. 
      - Add the kafir lime leaves, desicated coconut and sugar and stir until well blended.
      - Change the heat to low, cover the sauce pan with a lid and simmer for 1.5 hours.
      - When the curry is about 20 minutes away from being done, rinse the white rice in a sieve under a tap to remove excess starch.
      - Put the rice into a small saucepan with 800ml of cold water, 3 tbsp of desicated coconut and the remainder of the coconut milk.
      - Heat the rice on a medium heat until it starts bubbling. Then turn the heat down to the lowest setting, cover, and cook until the water is gone.
      - Add additional salt and sugar to the curry depending on your taste and serve.
