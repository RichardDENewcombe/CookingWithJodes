    directions_markdown: |-
      - Rinse the rice thorougly under the cold water tap in a sieve to remove excess starch. 
      - Add the rice to a sauce pan with 800 ml of cold water and a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat until it bubbles. 
      - Turn the heat down on the rice to the lowest setting and cover with a lid. Simmer until all of the water has gone, but try to avoid removing the lid where possible.
      - While the rice is cooking, combine the garlic, ginger, oyster, hoisin, dark soy, light soy, chilli flakes, Worcestershire sauce and pepper into a small bowl.  
      - When the rice is cooked, spread it out evenly on a tray that will fit your refridgerator. Refridgerate for at least 1 hour until cool all over.
      - After the rice has been in the refridgerator for approximately 40 minutes, coat your tuna steaks in lemon juice and sprinkle with dried parsley (or chosen meat) according to its instructions.
      - When the rice is cool, heat the sesame oil in a frying pan. Cook the carrots and onions together for 5 minutes.
      - Next, add the cold rice, peas and sweetcorn and cook for 4 minutes whilst continuously stirring with a wooden spoon. 
      - Add the sauce mixture and continue stirring and cooking for another 4-5 minutes or until hot. 
      - Serve even mixtures into a bowl and place the tuna steaks on top.
