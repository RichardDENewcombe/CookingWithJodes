  recipe:
    servings: 9-12 croquettes
    prep: 10 minutes
    cook: 1 hour
    ingredients_markdown: |-
      * 200 ml of vegetable oil
      * 3 large potatoes
      * 1 tbsp of butter
      * A splash of soya milk (or cows milk if you prefer)
      * 250g extra mature cheddar cheese, grated
      * 6-8 rashers of smoked back bacon
      * 2-3 medium eggs
      * A pack of panko breadcrumbs (or 4-5 slices of bread if like me, you forgot to pick up panko breadcrumbs when shopping!)

      - Peel and chop the potatoes into small chunks, roughly 4 cm in size. Try to get them as evenly as possible to avoid some chunks being cooked more than others.
      - Place the chopped potatoes into a pan with cold water. Cook on a medium heat until they are soft (roughly 20 minutes - if you can break up a chunk by putting a fork into it, this is a good sign it's done).
      - While the potatoes are cooking, grill the bacon until cooked to your liking and grate the cheese.
      - Cut the bacon into small squares and put aside. 
      - When the potatoes are cooked through drain the water, put the butter in and start mashing until there are no visible lumps. 
      - Next add the grated cheese and a splash of milk and mash again, being sure to incorporate it as evenly as possible. 
      - Stir in the bacon squares and set the mix aside to cool down for a bit until it's not too hot to touch.
      - Meanwhile, beat the eggs and put into a bowl. Put the panko breadcrumbs into another bowl. If you don't have panko breadcrumbs, lightly toast 4-5 slices of bread and break them up in a food processor).
      - Using your hands, mold the potato mixture into a cylinder shape.
      - Next, dip it into the egg mixture making sure to cover evenly. Then into the breadcrumbs.
      - Repeat until all of the mixture is used.
      - Heat the oil in a pan over a medium to high heat. To test if it is up to temperature, put a breadcrumb in to see if it sizzles.
      - Place 3 to 4 croquettes into the pan (depending on size) and cook evenly on each side until golden brown.
      - Serve right away or freeze to use for a later date (up to 3 months).
