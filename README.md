#Cooking with Jodes

During the pandemic my girlfriend got heavily into cooking and wanted a website she could use to share recipes with her family and keep as an online recipe book.

I started out by using a gatsby template to complete this to allow her to get up and running with it quickly.

This was a rewrite of the website using the gatsby template as design inspiration whilst I dived into learning SvelteKit and dynamic routing through it's endpoints.
